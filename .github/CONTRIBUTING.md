# Contributing

## Feature requests and bugs

Please submit any feature requests or bugs as an [issue](https://github.com/justeat/httpclient-interception/issues) in GitHub.

## Pull requests

If you wish to contribute code, please consider the guidelines below:

  1. Create an issue detailing the motivation for the change.
  1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
  1. Create a branch to work on your changes.
  1. Try to commit changes in a logical manner. Messy histories will be squashed if merged.
  1. Please follow the existing code style and [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) formatting settings.
  1. If fixing a bug or adding new functionality, add any tests you deem appropriate.
  1. Ensure ```build.ps1```/```build.sh``` runs with no errors or warnings and all the tests pass.
  1. Open a pull request against the ```master``` branch, referencing your issue, if appropriate.

Once your pull request is opened, the project maintainers will assess it for validity and an appropriate level of quality. For example, the Pull Request status checks should all be green.

If the project maintainers are satisfied that your contribution is appropriate it will be merged into the master branch when appropriate and it will then be released when the library is next published to [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/JUSTEAT_OSS).
